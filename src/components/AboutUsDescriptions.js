While existing systems track consumption for water and electricity in every household, no such measure exists for waste disposal. In a high connectivity like Singapore, there are endless possibilities of utilizing IoT solutions in waste management. Supported by the South West Community Development Council and the National Environmental Agency, the WasteLess team hopes to prove the effectiveness of behavioural nudging in managing domestic waste production.",
